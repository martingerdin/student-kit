# Project 20 weeks 
Most projects that I supervise run for 20 weeks, which is equivalent
to one semester in Swedish universities. I recommend that you put in a
lot of work during the first 10 weeks, and even more so during the
initial four weeks, to make sure that you meet project deadlines and
achieve the desired learning outcomes. The timeline here is a
suggestion that I've found to work well for most projects.

## Week 1
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- Create a project specific repository and name it something appropriate (GOOD: predict-preventable-deaths, BAD: Master-thesis)
- Install R, RStudio and try [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
- Join the team on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/teambengaltiger/shared_invite/zt-9pyvrok0-9OpClFBfWuTdxInVP_gxrw)
- Check out Johanna Berg's [student demo](https://github.com/tracits/StudentDemo) and learn how to integrate RStudio and GitHub
- Read up
- Draft a detailed timeline with dates and deliveries and upload to
  your project repository
- Draft a [study plan](study-plan.md) based on the appropriate study
  reporting guideline, for example
  [STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/)
  or
  [TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/),
  and upload to your project repository.
