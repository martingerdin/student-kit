# Student kit

**I'm happy that you're considering taking on a project with me as your supervisor!**

This repository includes some generic information that applies to most projects that I supervise. It also outlines my expectations on our collaboration, and what you can expect from me as your supervisor. 

To get the most out of this repository start by reading about the [project timeline](project-timeline.md) and then read and download the [study plan template](study-plan.md). End by reading about my [expectations](expectations.md). 

## Short bio

I am an Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, and a Resident in Anesthesia and Intensive Care at Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, both in Stockholm, Sweden. My primary line of research is the prediction and prevention of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, and my focus has so far been on the development and validation of prediction models for early trauma care as well as the evaluation
of system level interventions for improved trauma care. Most of my research is based in India where I have coordinated multicentre projects since 2013. My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Laerdal Foundation.
