# Student kit

**I'm happy that you're considering taking on a project with me as your supervisor!**

This repository includes some generic information that applies to most projects that I supervise. It also outlines my expectations on our collaboration, and what you can expect from me as your supervisor. 

To get the most out of this repository start by reading about the [project timeline](project-timeline.md) and then read and download the [study plan template](study-plan.md). End by reading about my [expectations](expectations.md). 

## Previous projects

These are student papers that have been published. Please read to get a more concrete idea of the kind of projects I supervise.
