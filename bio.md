I am an Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, and 
a Resident in Anesthesia and Intensive Care at Function Perioperative Medicine and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, both 
in Stockholm, Sweden. My primary line of research is the prediction and prevention of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, 
and my focus has so far been on the development and validation of prediction models for early trauma care as well as the evaluation
of system level interventions for improved trauma care. Most of my research is based in India where I have coordinated multicentre projects 
since 2013. My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, and the Laerdal Foundation.
